# ribbon-gallery (Layer Showcase)

A configurable application that displays a collection of layers from a group to support exploration of geographic content in both 2D and 3D views.

The Layer Showcase allows you to display a gallery of layers within a group. This app is handy for allowing users to explore layer-based content, viewing it on a map or globe, and optionally creating a new map based on the layers that have been added to the view. The vast majority of your work should go into styling and documenting the layer items, you can then share the layers with a group to deliver content via the Layer Showcase. This is a simple and interactive way to allow users to browse a group of content and then transition from layers to maps.

The side panel of the Layer Showcase opens with group description, including graphics, text, and links. When you click a layer info button, or add a layer, the side panel populates with the description from the layer item. The Layer Showcase includes a Table of Contents, visible minimized in the right corner of the map, which can be used to view the layer legend, change layer order, or remove all or selected layers. The side panel and the ribbon are retractable using the panel handles.
